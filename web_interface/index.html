         	<div class="panel-body">Choosing the appropriate dataset was the most difficult challenge that we faced. It was easy to find out the names of all the scientists who won the Nobel Prize, but it wasn't so easy to decide on where to find the "unsuccessful" examples that we can perform the classification on, without posing a bias on the dataset. In the end, we decided that it makes the most sense to scrape the list of scientists (physicists, chemists, and biologists) from Wikipedia.

                To classify scientists into the winner and non-winner group, we chose the following attributes:
                <ul>
                    <li>Country of Origin</li>
                    <li>Date of Birth</li>

Influenced by this, we decided to calculate this index ourselves and use it as an attribute for our data set. Because of the limitation on citation data that we have, we could not directly apply the PageRank algorithm, but had to create a variant of it. More specifically, we used the following formula:</p> <div><img class=img-center src="./img/formula.png"></img></div> where I is the citation score of a paper, alpha is a weight that can be adjusted, and p is the citation score of a paper that cites the paper in consideration. The recursion depth of the algorithm was applied only once due to the limitation in data collection process. This is explained further in the data collection process section.</div>

          <h2>The Nobel Prize Predictor</h2>
        </div>

        <p>The Nobel Prize is arguably the most prestigious award an individual can get in the academia. Awarded for "the Benefit on Mankind", the Nobel Prize is given to those who have made a significant contribution to the field of natural sciences like Chemistry, Physiology/Medicine, and Physics, and social sciences like Economics and Literature.</p>
        <p>Since 1901, there has been 889 winners of the Nobel Prize. Because Nobel Laureates include legendary figures such as Albert Einstein, Enrico Fermi, and Marie Curie, not only the academia but the public are also interested in guessing who the winner will be for each year.</p>
        <p>Unfortunately, the process of Nobel Prize selection is very complicated. Each year, the Nobel Prize Committee selects a few nominators who secretly makes the nominations. The nominations are concealed for the following 50 years, making it difficult for finding out even the candidates for the prize.</p>
        <p>With the use of machine learning, we decided to tackle this problem and make a model that can predict whether a scientist will win the Nobel Prize in the natural sciences area (Chemistry, Physics, and Physiology/Medicine) in the future.</p>

        <h2>Data Collection Process</h2>
    	<div class="panel panel-default">
         	<div class="panel-heading">Wikipedia</div>
         	<div class="panel-body">
            We scraped the names of scientists from three different Wikipedia pages.
            <ul>
              <li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_chemists">List of Chemists</a></li>
              <li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_physicists">List of Physicists</a></li>
              <li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_biologists">List of Biologists</a></li>
            </ul>
            These pages contained both winners and non-winners of the Nobel Prize in the three natural sciences disciplines. However, there were also some problems involved with Wikipedia. Since Wikipedia is an open-source encyclopedia where everyone can freely edit the contents, the quality of the content wasn't always very reliable. For example, Xi Jinping (China's Prime Minister) was in the list of chemists in the Wikipedia. However, it didn't matter too much because these inevitably formed the outliers of the data when we started collecting their attributes.
            We scraped names off of these lists specifically because all the attributes we wanted to collect were available in Wikipedia pages of most scientists, and we decided that it would pose the least bias for us to scrape Wikipedia pages of all scientists that are available to us. Furthermore, this drastically decreased the number of missing attributes in our data set since our sample data was limited to those who at least have a Wikipedia page. A downside of this decision is that it actually gives us only about 950 instances, which may or may not be enough for building an accurate model.

        <div class="panel panel-default">
         	<div class="panel-heading">Google Scholar</div>
            <div class="panel-body">
                <p>Google Scholar is arguably the richest source of citation data that is publicly available. However, Google has a very strict <a href="https://support.google.com/websearch/answer/86640">policy</a> against automated queries, and this made the scaping process extremely difficult. Not only does Google drop any packets that are not from browsers but also it has very sophisticated bot detection method.</p> 
                <p>By giving modifications to our HTTP request header, we were able to successfully scrape the data for a few scientists (~ 10 scientists) but after that, Google permanently blocked the IP address of my query. Any attempt to trick Google by sending a query between random intervals of 20-30 seconds did not work either, and it was unclear how Google was detecting my scraper.</p>
                <img src="./img/google.png" class="img-responsive img-center"></img>
                <p>Consequently we manually searched through all chemists name in Google Scholar and set the recursion depth of our PageRank score calculation algorithm to only 2, instead of the initial plan of 3. To facilitate the process we wrote a short script in JavaScript that extracts just the citation counts from a given page. In the process of doing this we also found out that Google thinks we are bots even when we were doing them by hand. It seemed like Google was simply blocking the IP if there were more than certain amount of queries over the time, which meant that in order to get around their bot detection method, the bot would have to go slower than our hand, which sort of defeats our purpose of using the bot.</p> </div>
